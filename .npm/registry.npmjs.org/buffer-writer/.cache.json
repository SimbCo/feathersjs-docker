(1 byte for character, 1 BE Int32 for length of the buffer)\n\n### var buffer = writer.join()\n\nCollects all data in the writer and joins it into a single, new buffer.\n\n### var buffer = writer.flush(char)\n\nWrites the 5 byte postgres required message header, collects all data in the writer and joins it into a single, new buffer, and then resets the writer.\n\n## thoughts\n\nThis is kind of node-postgres specific.  If you're interested in using this for a more general purpose thing, lemme know.\nI would love to work with you on getting this more reusable for your needs.\n\n## license\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"brianc","email":"brian.m.carlson@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-02-15T16:43:38.108Z","created":"2013-12-12T23:32:53.134Z","1.0.0":"2013-12-12T23:32:53.677Z","1.0.1":"2016-02-15T16:43:38.108Z"},"author":{"name":"Brian M.
